# Privacy Policy for PromptsReader

**Last Updated:** September 3, 2025

Thank you for using PromptsReader. Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy explains how our browser extension handles your data.

## Data Handling and Collection

PromptsReader is designed to function entirely on your local device. We believe in privacy by design and operate under the following principles:

1. **No Data Collection:** We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal or sensitive data. The extension does not have any functionality to send data to any external servers or third-party services.

2. **Local Storage Only:** All data created or managed by the extension, such as your prompts or settings, is stored exclusively on your local computer using the browser's built-in storage mechanisms (e.g., `chrome.storage`). This data never leaves your browser and is under your control. You can clear this data at any time by clearing your browser's storage or by uninstalling the extension.

3. **No User Tracking or Analytics:** We do not use any tracking scripts, cookies, or analytics services to monitor your usage of the extension.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page.
