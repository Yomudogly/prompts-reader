# Security Documentation

## 1. Content Handling

* **Primary Principle**: All content fetched from a user's GitHub repository will be treated as **plain text**.
* **XSS Prevention**: React's default behavior of rendering text without interpreting it as HTML will be strictly relied upon. No mechanisms like `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` will be used, which prevents Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

## 2. Input Validation

* **Scope**: The only user-provided input is the GitHub repository URL on the options page.
* **Action**: This URL will be validated on the client-side to ensure it is a well-formed `github.com` URL before being saved or used in an API call.

## 3. Authentication & Authorization

* **Authentication**: Not applicable for the MVP, as the extension operates with unauthenticated requests to public repositories.
* **Authorization**: Not applicable, as there are no user roles or permissions within the extension itself.

## 4. Data Storage

* **Sensitive Data**: The extension will not handle or store any sensitive user information like passwords, API keys (for the MVP), or personal data. Users are implicitly responsible for ensuring their designated public repository does not contain sensitive information.
