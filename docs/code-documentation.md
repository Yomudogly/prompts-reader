# Code Documentation Plan

## 1. Inline Code Comments

* **Practice**: Inline comments (`// ...`) will be added to the source code to explain any logic that is complex or not immediately self-evident.
* **Focus Areas**: Special attention will be given to commenting on the logic for recursively fetching data from the GitHub API and parsing the file structure into tags.

## 2. README.md

* **Requirement**: A comprehensive `README.md` file is considered a core deliverable for the project.
* **Contents**:
  * Project description and purpose.
  * A GIF or screenshot of the extension in action.
  * Installation and usage instructions for end-users.
  * A local development setup guide for contributors.

## 3. Architecture Visualization

* **Method**: A simple data flow diagram will be created using Mermaid syntax.
* **Purpose**: To provide a high-level visual overview of how data moves through the extension.
* **Location**: The diagram will be included in the `README.md`.
