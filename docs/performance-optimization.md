# Performance Optimization Plan

## 1. Frontend Performance

* **Primary Goal**: Ensure the extension's popup UI opens and becomes interactive instantly.
* **Strategy**: The UI will load all prompt data directly from the local `chrome.storage` cache. No network requests will be made when the popup is opened, eliminating network latency as a bottleneck.
* **Search Performance**: The search feature will perform a client-side filter on the cached array of prompts. This operation is computationally inexpensive and will provide real-time filtering as the user types.

## 2. Backend Performance

* **Primary Goal**: Minimize the number of API requests made to the GitHub API to avoid rate limiting and reduce network traffic.
* **Strategy**: A robust caching mechanism will be implemented.
* **Implementation**:
  * **Caching**: Prompt data will be cached in `chrome.storage.local` with a 24-hour expiration.
  * **Data Fetching**: API calls will only be triggered under two conditions:
    1. The user initiates a manual refresh.
    2. The existing cache is older than 24 hours.
