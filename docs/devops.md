# DevOps Documentation

## 1. Source Control & Hosting

* **Platform**: **GitHub**. A private or public repository will be used to host the source code and manage versions with Git.

## 2. Continuous Integration (CI)

* **Platform**: **GitHub Actions**.
* **Workflow**: A CI workflow will be configured to run on every push to the `main` branch.
* **Jobs**:
  1. **Setup**: Check out the code and install Node.js.
  2. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` (or equivalent package manager command).
  3. **Build**: Execute the Plasmo build command (`plasmo build --zip`) to create a production-ready, zipped package of the extension.
  4. **Archive**: The resulting `.zip` file will be saved as a build artifact, making it easy to download for deployment.

## 3. Deployment

* **Platform**: **Chrome Web Store**.
* **Process**: The `.zip` file generated by the GitHub Action will be **manually uploaded** to the Chrome Web Store developer dashboard for review and publishing.
