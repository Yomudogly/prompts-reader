# Product Requirements Document (PRD): GitHub Prompt Extension

## 1. Overview

* **Product Name:** GitHub Prompt Extension (Placeholder Name)
* **Description:** A Chromium browser extension that allows users to connect their own public GitHub repository of prompts and access them instantly within the browser via a searchable popup.
* **Problem Statement:** Users who work with LLMs frequently experience workflow friction by having to switch between their main browser window and a separate application or tab to find and copy prompts.
* **Goal:** To eliminate context switching and provide immediate, keyboard-driven access to a user's personal prompt library, streamlining their workflow.

## 2. Target Audience

* **Primary Users:** Developers, AI enthusiasts, and content creators who regularly use LLMs.
* **User Persona:** A technical user who maintains a curated list of prompts in a GitHub repository and wants to optimize their workflow for speed and convenience.

## 3. Features & Prioritization

### 3.1. MVP (Target: 1 Week)

* **User Configuration:** An options page where a user can input and save the URL of their public GitHub repository.
* **Data Fetching:** The extension will fetch and parse the contents of `.md`, `.xml`, and `.txt` files from the specified repository.
* **UI Popup:** A clean, simple popup interface to display the list of fetched prompts.
* **Search Functionality:** A basic text input field to search and filter prompts by their filename.
* **Keyboard Shortcut:** A configurable keyboard shortcut to quickly open the prompt popup.
* **Copy Action:** A single-click mechanism (e.g., a button) to copy the entire content of a selected prompt to the clipboard.

### 3.2. Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

* **Settings Sync:** Use browser storage sync to persist the user's repository URL across their devices.
* **Tagging System:** Implement a system for users to add and filter by tags for better prompt organization.
* **Content Search:** Enhance search to look inside the prompt content, not just the filename.

## 4. Platform

* **Target:** Chromium-based browsers (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, etc.).

## 5. Success Metrics

* **MVP Success:** The initial group of users (you and your friends) successfully adopt the tool and report a noticeable improvement in their prompt-handling workflow.
